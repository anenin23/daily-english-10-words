With three neighbouring armies already on the ground, a conflict that has **simmered** in Democratic Republic of Congo’s eastern borderlands for years is evolving into a wider regional war.

Several African armies joined the **fray** in Congo during wars of the 1990s and early 2000s and millions of people died, mainly from hunger and disease triggered by years of conflict and foreign occupation.

Why someone would stop and restart these medications is a **nuanced** question.

The Ukrainian president’s **genuflexion** brought him no **respite**.

“If Mr Trump wants a thank you, we will be writing it on the gravestones of dead Ukrainian soldiers,” **seethed** one Ukrainian officer.

depending on progress in planned **shuttle** diplomacy and unspecified “confidence-building measures”, America would “take a hard look at lifting this pause”.

Suspicions are all the deeper given Mr Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on European countries and his vice-president’s **denunciation** of European democracy and support for hard-right parties.

Britain says the “reassurance” force—a coalition of the willing expected to number some 20,000 to 30,000 troops behind Ukrainian frontline units—would need a strong American “backstop” to deter Russia. Mr Trump has **demurred**.

In trying to stop the **rift** with America, Europe may **hasten** it.

 If you want to add or correct something and you are able to supply references for it that meet Wikipedia’s increasingly stringent standards for reliability, you can make an edit and see if it passes **muster**.
